# ImageMagick 7 buildpack for Cloud Foundry

## Why use this buildpack

Cloud Foundry base stack `cflinuxfs3` includes legacy ImageMagick v6+, whereas modern ImageMagick is v7+.

Without this buildpack you will see ImageMagick 6.9.7 or so:

```plain
$ cf ssh myapp
# /tmp/lifecycle/shell
# convert -version
Version: ImageMagick 6.9.7-4 Q16 x86_64 20170114 http://www.imagemagick.org
```

With this buildpack you will see ImageMagick 7.0.8 or higher:

```plain
$ cf ssh phpapp
# /tmp/lifecycle/shell
# convert -version
Version: ImageMagick 7.0.8-49 Q16 x86_64 2019-06-10 https://imagemagick.org
Copyright: Â© 1999-2019 ImageMagick Studio LLC
License: https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php
Features: Cipher DPC HDRI OpenMP(4.5)
Delegates (built-in): bzlib djvu fontconfig freetype jbig jng jpeg lcms lqr lzma openexr png tiff wmf x xml zlib
```

## Why not use this buildpack

Some language bindings do not yet support ImageMagick v7, such as:

* Ruby [`rmagick`](https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick) - [estimated support for ImageMagick7 Summer 2019](https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/issues/256)

    cf create-buildpack [BUILDPACK_NAME] [BUILDPACK_ZIP_FILE_PATH] 1
    cf push my_app [-b BUILDPACK_NAME]
    ```
